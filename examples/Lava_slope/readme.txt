Simulation example of an effusion of lava from a circular vent on an inclined plane merging continuously into a horizontal plane. 
Two simulations with different resolution are presented.
The transport of temperature is solved but the momentum equation is decoupled from temeprature evolution (constant viscosity).
This test is intended to present the effects of different numerical parameters on the numerical solution. Please repeat the tests changing the parameter LIMITER (from 0 to 3) and the Runge-Kutta order (3 and 4) in the namelist NUMERIC_PARAMETERS.
