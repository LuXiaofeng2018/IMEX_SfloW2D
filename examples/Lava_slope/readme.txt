Simulation example of an effusion of from a circular vent on an inclined plane and merging continuously into a horizontal plane. 
Two simulation with different resolution are presented.
This test is intended to present the effects of different limiters on the numerical solution. Please repeat the tests changing the parameter LIMITER in the namelist NUMERIC_PARAMETERS.
