In this folder some examples are provided:

- **Example 1**. 1D test for a Riemann problem with a discontinuous topography and no friction. The exact solution consists of a left-going rarefaction wave and a right-going shock-wave. 
- **Example 2**. 1D test for a Riemann problem with a discontinuous topography and friction. The exact solution contains a composite triple wave, which consists of a sonic rarefaction, attached to a contact, followed by a zero speed shock and another contact.
- **Example 3**. 1D test for a system with discontinuous topography and friction. Presence of friction guarantees uniqueness of the steady state solution. 
- **Example 4**. 2D test for an avalanche of finite granular mass sliding down an inclined plane merging continuously into a horizontal plane. A Voellmy-Salm rhology with mu=0.3 and xi=300 is used.
- **Example 5**. 1D test for pyroclastic avalanche with a Voellmy-Salm rheology over a constant slope topography. 
- **Example 6**. 2D simulation of pyroclastic avalnche performed over the 2014 Digital Elevation Model of Mount Etna.

In each folder there are pre-processing and post-processing Phyton scripts. For the usage read the file README.txt.
