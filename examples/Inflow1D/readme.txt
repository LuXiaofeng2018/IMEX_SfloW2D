1D lava flow test with prescribed h and u at the inlet (west), resulting in a supercritical flow at t=0 and x=0. 
Temperature equation is also solved with viscous heating, conduction, convection and radiation. 
A temperature dependent viscosity model is used (rheology_model=3). 
The initial condition is prescribed as zero initial volume in the domain (h=0).
Three different slopes with different reference viscosities are tested:
Slope00 - Flat topography with reference dynamic viscosity of 1 Pa.s
Slope05 - Constant slope topography (5 degrees) with reference dynamic viscosity of 100 Pa.s
Slope10 - Constant slope topography (10 degrees) with reference dynamic viscosity of 100 Pa.s
