Example 4.1

Simulation example of an avalanche of finite granular mass sliding down an inclined plane and merging continuously into a horizontal plane is presented. A hemi-spherical shell holding the material together is suddenly released so that the bulk material commences to slide on an inclined flat plane at 35° into a horizontal run-out plane connected by a smooth transition.
