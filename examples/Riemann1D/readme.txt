Example 3 from Kurganov et al. 2007, Commun. Math. Sci. vol. 5, no. 1, 133-160 (2007)

1D Riemann problem with dry state and discontinuous bottom. The bottom topography is a step function with a discontinuity in x=0.5.
The gravitational constant is g=2. No friction terms are included in this simulation.
