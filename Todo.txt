1) Split the namelist newrun parameters in two namelist: newrun and initial_condition. DONE (2016/12/23)

2) the initial_condition should be read only when a flag is set to true in the input file, 
   otherwise the initial condition should be read from a file. DONE (2016/12/23)

3) the initial condition should be read from a file in different formats: *.q, *.p or *.asc

4) move the parameters related to the numerical scheme from the run_parameters namelist to a new one. DONE (2016/12/23)

5) add a check for the coverage of the DEM and the size of the computational domain
