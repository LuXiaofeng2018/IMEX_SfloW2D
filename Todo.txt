1) Complete the Doxygen documentation

2) Add tutorials in the examples folder for the examples from K&P. Each tutorial should have a separate folder with: readme.txt, topography file as a .asc, initial condition as a .asc, shallow_water.inp file

3) Add multiple folders for the same example with different number of cells

4) Add scripts to create DEMs and initial conditions for tutorials

5) Work on the wiki

6) change the name of the input file to IMEX_SfloW2D.inp

7) Add transport equation for temperature with a flag to solver for it. DONE (2017/01/04)

8) Change the notation for the boundaries. It would be better to have W,E,N,S.

1) Split the namelist newrun parameters in two namelist: newrun and initial_condition. DONE (2016/12/23)

2) the initial_condition should be read only when a flag is set to true in the input file, 
   otherwise the initial condition should be read from a file. DONE (2016/12/23)

3) the initial condition should be read from a file in different formats: *.q, *.p or *.asc. DONE (2016/12/23)

4) move the parameters related to the numerical scheme from the run_parameters namelist to a new one. DONE (2016/12/23)
